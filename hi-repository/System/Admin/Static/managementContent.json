			  "Caching - Caching and persistence is an optimization technique in which saves the result of RDD evaluation. Using this we save the intermediate result so that we can use it further if required. It reduces the computation overhead.","Persist-When we use the cache we can store all the RDD in-memory. We can persist the RDD in memory and use it efficiently across parallel operations.","Levels of Persist 1.MEMORY_ONLY. 2.MEMORY_AND_DISK 3.MEMORY_ONLY_SER 4.MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER 5.DISK_ONLY"],
